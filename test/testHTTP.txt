Great! Since combining the script into a single block worked for you, that suggests the problem with running the script as a background job was likely related to how the background job context handled the separate code components or execution environment.

Here are a few more steps to ensure smooth operation and to handle background job scenarios effectively:

### Final Steps to Optimize and Ensure Stability

1. **Verify Continuous Operation**

Make sure the server continues to run correctly even if the session is closed or the user logs off:

- **Use `Start-Process`**: For more control and stability, consider running the script in a separate PowerShell process instead of a background job. This can be done using `Start-Process`:

  ```powershell
  $scriptPath = "C:\path\to\your\game-server-script.ps1"
  Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-File `"$scriptPath`"" -NoNewWindow
  ```

2. **Handle Errors and Logging**

Add error handling and logging to capture issues and debug information:

- **Error Handling**: Wrap critical sections in `try-catch` blocks:

  ```powershell
  try {
      # Your main logic here
  } catch {
      Write-Host "Error: $_"
  }
  ```

- **Logging**: Use `Write-Log` or `Out-File` to log errors and important events:

  ```powershell
  function Write-Log {
      param ([string]$Message)
      $logFile = "C:\path\to\logfile.log"
      $Message | Out-File -Append -FilePath $logFile
  }
  
  # Use Write-Log for logging
  Write-Log "Server started successfully"
  ```

3. **Optimize Port Usage**

Ensure that the port you are using is free and available for your application:

- **Check Port Availability**: Before starting the server, check if the port is available:

  ```powershell
  $port = 8082
  $isPortOpen = Test-NetConnection -Port $port
  if ($isPortOpen) {
      Write-Host "Port $port is already in use."
  } else {
      Write-Host "Port $port is available."
  }
  ```

4. **Ensure Robust Termination**

Handle clean shutdowns for the HTTP server:

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implement a mechanism to stop the server gracefully if needed:

  ```powershell
  function Stop-Server {
      $listener.Stop()
      $listener.Close()
      Write-Host "Server stopped."
  }

  # Add a signal handler or mechanism to call Stop-Server
  ```

5. **Check Firewall and Security Settings**

Verify that the firewall or security settings are not interfering with the server:

- **Add Firewall Rule**: Allow traffic on the port used by the server:

  ```powershell
  New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow Port 8082" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8082 -Action Allow
  ```

### Summary

By following these steps, you can ensure that your HTTP server script operates smoothly and robustly, even when running as a background job or a separate process. Implementing error handling, logging, and ensuring port availability and security settings will contribute to a stable and reliable service.
